import csv

# Writing CSV
data = [["Name", "Age"], ["Rahul", 25], ["Priya", 22]]
with open("data.csv", "w") as file:
    write = csv.writer(file)

# Reading CSV
with open("data.csv") as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)  # {'Name': 'Rahul', 'Age': '25'}
    print(dict(reader))


import json

# Writing JSON
user = {"name": "Rahul", "skills": ["Python", "Django"]}
with open("user.json", "w") as file:
    json.dump(user, file, indent=4)  # indent for pretty JSON
